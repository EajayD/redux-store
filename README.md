This is a simple application that utilizes an entire MERN stack convention with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node and Express packages to allow a user to shop for various items and checkout using Stripe. It was actually refactored to use Redux rather than using context APIs


## Installation

 First you want to clone this repository into your system

  ```
 https://github.com/EajayD/redux-store.git

  npm i 
  ```

  Once you have the node modules you can run the commands below in your terminal to initiate the program
